    % Objective
    \section{\mysidestyle Professional Objective}
    I am looking for an internship beginning in or after summer 2014 with a software development, data science, or computational modeling role at a technology or financial company working on data-driven, intellectually challenging problems.

     I study the molecular dynamics of the T cell receptor using molecular dynamics simulations.  I construct Markov models from the simulated data to build multiscale, discrete models of the dynamics to better understand the solution state dynamics of the system and how the flexibility of the CDR loops contributes to antigen recognition.  In the process of my research, I have studied and built software systems to manage terabyte-scale data sets, perform non-linear dimensionality reduction (manifold learning) of large in-memory data sets, and to automate the process of building markov models from data.  Additionally, I have contributed computational expertise in molecular docking and automation procedures to two other lab papers, and developed a molecular dynamics protocol and wrote data analysis scripts for a third paper outside my personal research.

    \textsl{Co-founder \& CTO} \hfill \textbf{Oct 2013 -- present} \vspace{-3mm}

    Artifice, NFP (www.artificechicago.org) is a direct service not-for-profit corporation located in the Woodlawn neighborhood on the south side of Chicago.  Artifice is a technology education center and youth hackerspace aimed at teaching underpriviledged youth computer programming, web design and development, robotics, and entrepreneurial skills.  As CTO, I oversee the architecture and development of our achievement tracking system, which, on completeion, will collect data from physical sensor systems and relay it to our servers for data tracking and analysis for grant reports.  The system will also provide a gamified front-end for students to track their own achievements.  As a developer, I primarily work on the Node.js back-end. Finally, I also act as a volunteer instructor, primarily teaching our introductory bootcamp (covering basic HTML5 and CSS3) and Python programming.
